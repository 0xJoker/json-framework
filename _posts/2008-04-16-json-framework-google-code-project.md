title: JSON Framework Google Code Project
---

*Please note this is now long gone, and stored on github instead.*

I've had more emails about the Cocoa JSON Framework than any of my other projects, so I decided to move it to <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/">Google Code</a>. I also set up a <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/json-framework">discussion group</a>, so people can help each other with problems rather than just email me. One important reason for this is that several of the requests I've had is about using the framework on the iPhone. (I don't have an iPhone and can't justify buying one soon.)

Some of the people that have signed up to the list have iPhones, and I'm hoping that to be able to integrate documentation and/or code arising from their discussions on the topic. I'm also excited to see what applications people are coming up with!
