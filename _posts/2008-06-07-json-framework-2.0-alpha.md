title: JSON Framework 2.0 Alpha
---

I've just uploaded a version 2 pre-release of my <a href="http://json-framework.googlecode.com/files/JSON_2.0a1.dmg">Objective-C JSON framework</a> to Google code. In addition to the category-based API this version adds an object-based API that is a bit more flexible.

You can read more about the <a href="http://devblog.brautaset.org/2008/05/26/json-framework-update/">new features</a> in this release in a previous post. You can also see some of the changes in the list of <a href="http://code.google.com/p/json-framework/issues/list?q=label%3Aversion-2.0&amp;can=1">closed issues</a> for Version 2.
