I'm pleased to announce that SBJson 3.1.1 is out, available immediately.

This is a bug fix release. This release is special in that it mainly contains code by other people. Thanks guys!

* Fix bug that could result in a long long overflow (Ole André Vadla Ravnås)
* Make SINGLETON thread safe (Alen Zhou)
* Updated .gitattributes to say that tests are binary files (Phill Baker)
* Fix string formatter warning in new XCode (Andy Brett)
* Fix issue that could lead to "bad access" or zombie errors (jonkean)
* Update links to API docs (me)
