title: SBJson v3.2.0 is out!

# Deprecations

The main focus of this release is to deprecate the `JSONValue` and `JSONRepresentation`
category methods, and several methods that return an error through an `NSError**`
argument. These will be removed in version 4. If you upgrade to v3.2 and you use any of
the deprecated methods you will get a warning at compile time.

# Changes

* Absorbing  the LICENSE and INSTALL files into README.
* Remove the Xcode Workspace from the top-level source checkout; the less
  clutter the better and this doesn't seem to serve any function.
* Change to use AppleDoc for creating API documentation. This results in
  output looking more consistent with Apple's documentation.

# Bugfixes

* Replace use of `INFINITY` with `HUGE_VAL` where used as double (reported by
Antoine CÅ“ur)
* Correctly parse `-0.0` as a JSON number (Cary Yang)
* Fail to compile unless compiled with ARC.
