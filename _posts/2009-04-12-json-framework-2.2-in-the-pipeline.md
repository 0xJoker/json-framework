title: JSON Framework 2.2 in the Pipeline

I've refactored the internals and provided a bit more convenient interface for getting at errors in Subversion trunk. (For example, you can now get a whole stack of errors in one go.) Updated API documentation is checked in to the repository and is available at <a href="http://json-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/index.html">http://json-framework.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/documentation/index.html</a>. What I haven't tackled properly yet is the installation issues, particularly on the iPhone. I'm a bit at a loss how to solve that still. Suggestions welcome!
