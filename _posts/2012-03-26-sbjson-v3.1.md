title: SBJson v3.1
---

The main change in this release is that SBJson v3.1 and above requires **Automatic
Reference Counting**. This means that 3.1 requires Xcode 4.2 or higher to build, because
previous versions did not have ARC support. If you can't use Xcode 4.2, or for some reason
can't use ARC, you need to stick with version 3.0.

To make this move simpler I decided to move to 64-bit only & remove
instance variables for properties.

Miscellaneous changes
---------------------

* Added an optional comparator that is used when sorting keys.
* Be more memory-efficient when parsing long strings containing escaped characters.
* Add a Workspace that includes the sample projects, for ease of browsing.
* Report error for numbers with exponents outside range of -128 to 127.
