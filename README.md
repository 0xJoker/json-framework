JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a light-weight data interchange
format that's easy to read and write for humans and computers alike.
This library implements chunk-based JSON parsing and generation in
Objective-C.

Features
========

SBJson's number one feature is chunk-based operation. Feed the parser one or
more chunks of UTF8-encoded data and it will call a block you provide with each
root-level document or array; or optionally for each top-level entry in one (or
more) root-level array. See more in the [Version 4 API
docs](http://sbjson.org/api/4.0/Classes/SBJson4Parser.html).

Other features:

* Configurable recursion limit. For safety SBJson defaults to a max nesting
  level of 32 for all input. This can be configured if necessary.
* The writer can optionally sort dictionary keys so output is consistent across writes.
* The writer can optionally create human-readable (indented) output.

Installation
============

The preferred way to use SBJson is by using
[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/?q=sbjson). *Note that there are 2 specs for
version 4.* In your Podfile use:

    pod 'SBJson', '~> 4.0.0'

If you depend on a third-party library that requires an earlier version of
SBJson, or want to install both version 3 and 4 in the same app to do a gradual
transition you can instead use:

    pod 'SBJson4', '~> 4.0.0'

An alternative (that I no longer recommend) is to copy all the source files (the
contents of the `src/main/objc` folder) into your own Xcode project.

That should be it. Now create that Twitter client!
