# Overview

A strict JSON parser and generator for Objective-C. It adds categories to
existing Objective-C objects for a super-simple interface. More flexible
APIs are also provided for added control.

Selected features:

* New BSD License.
* Easy-to-use API.
* Streaming Support. See SBJsonStreamParser in the [API docs](http://stig.github.com/json-framework/api/{{ page.current_api }}).
* Pretty-printing of JSON output.
* Sorted dictionary keys in JSON output.
* Configurable max recursion depth for parsing and writing.
* Pure Objective-C.
* No external dependencies.
